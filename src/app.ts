// Finishing the development of our API, let’s include a very important module, 
// which is a security middleware that handles several kinds of attacks in the 
// HTTP/HTTPS protocols. This module is called helmet which is a set of nine internal 
// middlewares, responsible to treat the following HTTP settings:

// Configures the Content Security Policy;
// Removes the header X-Powered-By that informs the name and the version of a server;
// Configures rules for HTTP Public Key Pinning;
// Configures rules for HTTP Strict Transport Security;
// Treats the header X-Download-Options for Internet Explorer 8+;
// Disables the client-side caching;
// Prevents sniffing attacks on the client Mime Type;
// Prevents ClickJacking attacks;
// Protects against XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.
